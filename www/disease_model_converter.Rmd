The Disease Model Converter translates disease models into the canonical parameters: risk allele frequency in the control group, and odds ratio between allele variants.

Both methods of specification are sufficient for the purpose of power analysis, and each has its own advantages.
While the disease models may carry insights into the biological process, the canonical parameters are  usually better estimated, reported, and curated.
We elaborate on their relationships in [Help  &#8594; Disease Models Revisited](disease_models_revisited.html){target="_blank"}, where we also provide some practical guidelines for choosing a method of specification.
