<p>The Disease Model Converter translates disease models into the canonical parameters: risk allele frequency in the control group, and odds ratio between allele variants.</p>
<p>Each method of specification has its own advantages. While the disease models may carry insights into the biological process, the canonical parameters are sufficient for the purpose of power analysis. We elaborate on their relationships in <a href="disease_models_revisited.html" target="_blank">Help â†’ Disease Models Revisited</a>, where we also enumerate some advantages of directly specifying the canonical parameters.</p>
